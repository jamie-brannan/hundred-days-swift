# *Day 64 • Monday June 21, 2021*

>Thomas Fuchs once said, **“the best error message is the one that never shows up.”** Of course, getting to that point is easier said than done – even in just your progress in this course so far you’ve almost certainly hit 50 or more bugs in your code, and had to figure out the problem then resolve it.

>In this small but important technique project we’re going to look at a few different ways of helping you identify problems in your code. Even though this is an important skill, I waited until now to show it to you because it’s important you first feel the problem acutely – you’ve hit bugs, and you’ve had to work hard to solve them. But now you’ve done that, you should be able to appreciate these debugging tips all the more!

Oh cool, looking forward to focusing on a skills outside of API knowledge :) 

>**Today you have five short topics to work through, and you’ll learn about `assert()`, breakpoints, view debugging, and more.**
