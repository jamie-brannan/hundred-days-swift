# Day 20, Week 15
:calendar: – Thursday June 25, 2020 

*At home* :house:

>You’re already 1/5th of the way through the 100 Days of Swift, and you’re still coming back – that’s amazing, and I hope you feel proud that your consistency and persistency are paying off.
>
>Years ago Steve Jobs said, "I believe life is an intelligent thing: that things aren't random.” I don’t know whether he’s right or wrong, but I do know that things really ought to be random if we’re playing a game, otherwise it wouldn’t be much fun!
>
>So, today we’ll be completing project two by showing random flags, letting the user make their guess, and showing a score alert. This could have involved using closures for the first time, but here we’re going to take a little shortcut so you can start to get a feel for how closures, functions, and methods are really different flavors of the same thing.
>
>Today you have just two topics to work through, and you’ll meet array shuffling, random number generation, @IBAction, and UIAlertController.
>
>Guess which flag: random numbers
>From outlets to actions: creating an IBAction
>Hopefully those two shouldn’t prove too much work for you, so you should have a little time to experiment with your code before tomorrow’s challenges.
