# 100 Days of Swift Challenge :rocket:

Here we go! This is the home of the efforts at taking on [Hacking Swift's 100 Days of Swift challenge](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100)
> Everything that is marked in comment (`.md` format `> text` or `/```swift/` blocks) is Paul Hudsons work I am taking notes on, and not my original thought unless otherwise indicated

## Study Structure

Days organized by folders containing
* ressources consulted
* notes sheet in markdown
* `playground` and other Xcode run code files used for practice

## :hammer: Built With
* Markdown and custom snippets
* Swift
* Xcode (playgrounds)
* Asses from [Hacking Swift Github project repo](https://github.com/twostraws/HackingWithSwift/)

## :calendar: Schedule log

|---|---|---|---|
| Day 32 | November 5, 12 | ~ | Review fundamentals and ShoppingList app challenge |

### :seven: **Codable, buttons and GCD**
