>One of the joys of working on Apple platforms is that it can feel like there’s no end to exciting technologies to try – whether that’s ARKit, Core ML, SpriteKit, or any of the dozens of other things, I don’t think there’s ever been a better time to get into software development.
>
>But – and this is a big but! – as wonderful as those things are, a large part of our work as iOS developers is always going to involve the fundamentals of app development: receiving some data, formatting in a specific way, and making it look good on-screen.
>
>Today you’re going to meet one of the truly great features of Swift development, and it also happens to be part of probably the most important skill. That feature is called the Codable protocol, and its job is to convert Swift data like strings, dictionaries, or structs to and from data that can be transferred over the internet.
>
>Computing pioneer Mitch Kapor once said that “getting information off the internet is like taking a drink from a fire hydrant.” This is true: there’s a lot of it out there, and we need to be really careful how we read it in to our apps.
>
>Fortunately, Codable does most of the work for us – I think you’ll be impressed!
>
>Today you have three topics to work through, and you’ll learn about UITabBarController, Data, Codable, and more.
