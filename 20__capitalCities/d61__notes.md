>I could easily have written this whole course about UIKit, skipping out Core Image, SpriteKit, MapKit, and more. But my hope is that by immersing you in other Apple frameworks you’re starting to become soaked in their way of approaching things – you’re starting to build a build a gut instinct for how Apple’s framework work.
>
>I realize this place extra learning stress on you, because rather than staying within our comfort we’re constantly pushing forward into new things. It will help you in the long term, though – as James Bryant Conant said, “behold the turtle – it makes progress only when it sticks its neck out.”
>
>Today you’ve finished another app, and I hope feel like you have a basic grasp of how maps work. There’s a lot more you can do with them, such as adding placemarks, looking up locations, and finding directions, but I hope you can at least see that it’s all within your grasp now!
>
>**Today you should work through the wrap up chapter for project 16, complete its review, then work through all three of its challenges.**
>
>That’s another project finished, and one that gets you started with one of the most popular and powerful iOS frameworks – make sure you share your progress with others once you complete the challenges!
